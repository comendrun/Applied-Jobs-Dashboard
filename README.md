## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ReactJS

### What I learned

this challenge was a good way to practice SASS and SCSS and also I learned about its limitations. still, by now, I prefer CSS and its custom properties more.
also, it was good practice for my CSS grid knowledge, and watched a couple of videos about it.

### Continued development

I hope I can write a more concise and also shorter code for this kind of application, it's not that hard, and also it was tricky because I tried to DRY as much as I can but in the end, I could do what I wanted to. for example i don't know yet how to replace an addressed directory of an array with our state

```js
const directory = data.timeframes.daily.current;
```

for example, I wanted to change the directory when our state changes and just replace "daily" with our new state. but I wasn't able to do that yet. hopefully ill find another way around it.
