## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ReactJS
- react-spinner library

### What I learned

this challenge was a good way to practice SASS and SCSS and also I learned about its limitations. still, by now, I prefer CSS and its custom properties more.
also, it was good practice for my CSS grid knowledge, and watched a couple of videos about it.

#### How to make background-color to take a specific percent of the container:

I used this method by justisb from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8541081/css-set-a-background-color-which-is-50-of-the-width-of-the-window) that helped me to make my Job page background-color to take up a specific percentage of the container with the help of gradients.

### Continued development

<!-- I hope I can write a more concise and also shorter code for this kind of application, it's not that hard, and also it was tricky because I tried to DRY as much as I can but in the end, I could do what I wanted to. for example i don't know yet how to replace an addressed directory of an array with our state

```js
const directory = data.timeframes.daily.current;
```

for example, I wanted to change the directory when our state changes and just replace "daily" with our new state. but I wasn't able to do that yet. hopefully ill find another way around it. -->
