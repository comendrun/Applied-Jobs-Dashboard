## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ReactJS

### What I learned

this challenge was a good way to practise about SASS and SCSS and also i learned about its limitations. still by now i preffer CSS and its custom properties more.
also it was good practise for my css grid knowledge and watched a couple of videos about it.

### Continued development

I hope i can write a more concise and also shorter code for this kind of application, its not that hard and also it was a bit tricky, because i tried to DRY as much as i can but at the end i couldn do what i wanted to. for expamle i dont know yet how to replace an addressed directory of an array with our state

```js
const directory = data.timeframes.daily.current;
```

for example i wanted to change the directory when our state changes and just replacing "daily" with our new state. but i wasnt able to do that yet. hopefully ill find another way around.
