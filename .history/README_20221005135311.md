# Frontend Mentor - Job Applications Dashboard

This is an application which i created from this solution to the [Time tracking dashboard challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

- CSS custom properties
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ReactJS
- react-spinner library

### What I learned

this challenge was a good way to practice SASS and SCSS and also I learned about its limitations. still, by now, I prefer CSS and its custom properties more.
also, it was good practice for my CSS grid knowledge, and watched a couple of videos about it.

#### How to make background-color to take a specific percent of the container:

I used this method by justisb from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8541081/css-set-a-background-color-which-is-50-of-the-width-of-the-window) that helped me to make my Job page background-color to take up a specific percentage of the container with the help of gradients.

Update Sep 2022:
I started implementing a user authentication feature to the app, but faced some problems right from the start when I tried implementing react-router-dom-V6 with nested routes.
I tried many tutorials from youtube or their own document, but at the end I couldn't solve it. but then I find a solution on Stackoverflow[Nested routing is not working in React Router v6](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64291991/nested-routing-is-not-working-in-react-router-v6) from a user called [Samira](https://stackoverflow.com/users/12902108/samira) and that was it. the sweetest joy of solving the problem at the end! I wanted to give some credits to dear [Samira](https://stackoverflow.com/users/12902108/samira) here, since I used her method but couldn't upvote her solution as I'm not able yet on Satckoverflow.

#### How to send a state when changing the route from one route to another one:

so, this one was an interesting one (like all others :)). You can simply add a prop called state to your Link element- which is available through react-router-dom- and it will be sent through to the next route. Pretty amazing!

### Continued development

<!-- I hope I can write a more concise and also shorter code for this kind of application, it's not that hard, and also it was tricky because I tried to DRY as much as I can but in the end, I could do what I wanted to. for example i don't know yet how to replace an addressed directory of an array with our state

```js
const directory = data.timeframes.daily.current;
```

for example, I wanted to change the directory when our state changes and just replace "daily" with our new state. but I wasn't able to do that yet. hopefully ill find another way around it. -->
